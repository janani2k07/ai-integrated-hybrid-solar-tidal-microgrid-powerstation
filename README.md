# ai-integrated-hybrid-solar-tidal-microgrid-powerstation
We have developed an AI-Integrated Hybrid Solar-Tidal Floating Microgrid specifically designed for electrified maritime transport. By combining the power of the sun and the rhythm of the tides, we provide a continuous, 24/7 energy supply that does not depend on a single resource or an unreliable land-based grid.
